Healthcare Analytics Dashboard – A Data-Driven Approach to Population Health and Financial Insights

This interactive healthcare dashboard leverages patient-level data from Johns Hopkins University to offer a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of both clinical and financial performance in a healthcare setting. Developed using Power BI, the dashboard integrates diverse data sources—such as diagnoses, procedures, lab results, and billing records—to provide stakeholders with a unified view of population health, operational efficiency, and revenue cycles.

At the core of the dashboard is a risk stratification model, categorizing patients into Low Risk, Medium Risk, and High Risk segments based on parameters such as chronic conditions, abnormal lab values, and age. This segmentation enables a focused evaluation of healthcare delivery patterns, clinical burdens, and cost implications across risk categories. For instance, High-Risk patients, while representing a small proportion of the population, account for a disproportionately high share of average billing and extended lengths of stay—underscoring the need for proactive care management strategies.

Key features of the dashboard include:

Patient Risk Scoring based on clinical and demographic factors

Revenue Attribution by Diagnosis, highlighting top cost drivers like Type 2 diabetes, heart failure, and hypertension

Monthly Revenue Trends to monitor changes in financial performance

Department-Level Length of Stay Metrics, helping optimize bed utilization and throughput

Correlation of Age and Chronic Conditions with Revenue, revealing the impact of aging and multimorbidity on healthcare expenditure

The dashboard also presents a granular view of patient encounters, lab abnormalities, and procedure volumes—supporting decision-making for clinical operations, resource allocation, and preventive care initiatives. From a financial perspective, it highlights average revenue per patient and per encounter across risk levels, guiding strategic planning and budgeting efforts.

By combining clinical, operational, and financial metrics into one interactive platform, this dashboard empowers healthcare administrators, analysts, and clinicians to identify trends, assess performance, and take timely action. It supports value-based care initiatives by focusing on outcomes, efficiency, and high-cost patient cohorts, helping institutions achieve better health outcomes while maintaining financial sustainability.
